## Challenge

- Create an `express application` called **Express Challenge**
  - The entry point file will be `index` (not `app`).
  - Create a `gitignore` file and apply the necessary file or folders within it.
    - terminal in root folder `npm init -y`
- Set this application to accept `JSON`.
- This will run on a port of your choosing.
- Create a middleware function
  - This should be within it's own file and imported.
  - The function will need to capture the current time as a **timestamp**.
    - Consider: [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_date.asp).
    - Will need to store in the `req` a `timestamp` key that holds a value of HH:MM.
- Create a `data.json` file and inject the following: DONE
```json

[
    {
        "id":19,
        "title": "Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring",
        "author": "J.R.R. Tolkien"
    },
    {
        "id":24,
        "title": "Animal Farm",
        "author": "George Orwell"
    },
    {
        "id":97,
        "title": "Frankenstein",
        "author": "Mary Shelley"
    },
    {
        "id":32,
        "title": "Of Mice and Men",
        "author": "John Steinbeck"
    }
] DONE
```
- Create 4 different Routes:

  - GET
    - All items from `data.json`
    - This will have an empty endpoint.
  - GET
    - One by ID using params
  - GET
    - One by Title using query
  - POST
    - Accept a JSON that includes **title** and **author**.
    - This will NOT need to update the `data.json` file.
  - ALL routes requires to have a timestamp sent back with the response.
  - Consider if data is passed that doesn't exist in `data.json` a message to process within a new Error.
    - ex:
  ```js
  throw new Error('error message to send');
  ```
- Test each route within **POSTMAN**
  - There should be 4 different requests made

  ## Bonus:

- Create a function that handles the error handling within each route.

  - This function will be called if a `catch` is triggered.

- Within the `query` route, see if you can build a query search to consider both the author and/or title. How can this been considered when the data is being sent?

  - hint: Consider query variables against conditionals.
